## Running a CENNZnet node

There are a number of ways to run a CENNZnet node. Please choose one that suits best for your interest.

### Using Docker

Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine.
```
# Start a local validator on a development chain
$ docker run \
    -p 9933:9933 -p 9944:9944 \
    cennznet/cennznet:1.0.0-rc2 --dev --unsafe-ws-external --unsafe-rpc-external
```

### Using the source code

Follow the steps to build and run a node from the source code.

#### 1. Make sure build environment is set up

For Linux (the example below is for Debian-based machines):
```
$ sudo apt install -y build-essential clang cmake gcc git libclang-dev libssl-dev pkg-config
```

For MacOS (via Homebrew):
```
$ brew install openssl cmake llvm
```

For Windows [TODO: may need a separate link]

#### 2. Install Rust and set up Rust environment

Install Rust on your machine through [here](https://rustup.rs/), and the following rust version and toolchains.
```
$ cargo --version
$ rustup install nightly
$ rustup target add --toolchain=nightly wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

#### 3. Build the node binary and run

Then clone the repo, build the binary and run it.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cennznet/cennznet.git
$ cd cennznet
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/cennznet --help

# start a validator node for development
$ ./target/release/cennznet --dev
```
