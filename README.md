## Run a CENNZnet node

Easiest way to run a CENNZnet node is via docker:  
```bash
# Start a local validator on a development chain
$ docker run \
    -p 9933:9933 -p 9944:9944 \
    cennznet/cennznet:latest \
    --dev \
    --unsafe-ws-external \
    --unsafe-rpc-external
```

## Building the Project

Follow these steps to build and run CENNZnet from source.

### 1. Set up build environment

For Linux (the example below is for Debian-based machines):
```
$ sudo apt install -y build-essential clang cmake gcc git libclang-dev libssl-dev pkg-config
```

For MacOS (via Homebrew):
```
$ brew install openssl cmake llvm
```

For Windows follow [this guide](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/windows-users)  

### 2. Install Rust

Install Rust on your machine through [here](https://rustup.rs/), and the following rust version and toolchains.
```
$ cargo --version
$ rustup install nightly
$ rustup target add --toolchain=nightly wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### 3. Build and Run

Then clone the repo, build the binary and run it.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cennznet/cennznet.git
$ cd cennznet
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/cennznet --help

# start a validator node for development
$ ./target/release/cennznet --dev
```
