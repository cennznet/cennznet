## TODO:
- `tx.origin` vs. payable transfer to caller
- error codes if request fails?
- unused gas back to caller
- Add multi-currency fee payment for the callback
- Implement challenge protocol
    - Add staking for relayers (i.e. require bond or authority)
- Improve accurate weights and limit # of callbacks processed by on_idle
